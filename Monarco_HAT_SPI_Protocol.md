## Introduction

Primary data communication interface of Monarco HAT is an SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface). Monarco HAT act as an *SPI Slave*, host device (Raspbery Pi) act as an *SPI Master*.

SPI communication is organized into data transfers. Each data transfer is initiated by *SPI Master* which send N bytes to *SPI Slave*, and simultaneously *SPI Master* receive N bytes from *SPI Slave*.


## Data transfer basic principles

For such realtime input/output device like the Monarco HAT, it is common to define two classes of data communication:

* **Proces (cyclic) data channel - PDC:** contains input/output values - like current state of digital and analog inputs, input-based counters, and demanded state of digital and analog outpus. These values are required to be continuously refreshed by *SPI Master*, usually synchronously with each execution period of upper level control algorithm (e.g. task in realtime control system software).
* **Service (acyclic) data channel - SDC:** is used for configuration and diagnostics values - like RS-485 baudrate and mode, analog inputs type and range, input/output technology functions configuration, firmware version information, and various diagnostics counters. These values do not have to be read or written all the time or with each data transfer. So they can be communicated asynchronously using shared low bandwidth channel.

For ease of implementation of both *SPI Master* and *SPI Slave*, only two types of SPI transfer with predefined length are defined. The high level transfer structure is the same for both communication directions:

* **Standard transfer, length = 26 bytes:**
  * 4 bytes: Service data channel (SDC)
  * 20 bytes: Process data channel (PDC)
  * 2 bytes: Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)
* **[FUTURE] Service data only transfer, length = 6 bytes:**
  * 4 bytes: Service data channel (SDC)
  * 2 bytes: Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)

Length of process channel is 20 bytes by default. For future extensions, *SPI Master* can use *Service data only transfer* to reconfigure process channel contens. In such case, length of *Standard transfer* can be changed.

Service data are organized as set of 16 bit registers which can be read and written. See chapter *Service channel register description* below for details.

If valid process data are not received by Monarco HAT (*SPI Slave*) for longer time than *Watchdog Period* (100 ms by default), internal alarm is triggered and all outputs are switched to default states.


## SPI data transfer parameters

* Maximal SPI clock frequency: 4 MHz (limited by Monarco HAT's MCU SPI slave peripheral)
* SPI mode: `MODE0 -- CPOL = 0, CPHA = 0` - Clock idle low, data is valid on clock rising edge
* SPI data bits: 8


## Data transfer format

Byte order of 16/32 bit values is little-endian, e.g. least significant byte first.

### Control byte

<pre>
offset
   0.0  Status LED mask
   0.1  Status LED on
   0.2  1-Wire power shutdown
   0.3  RESERVED
   0.4  Counter 1 reset (edge sensitive)
   0.5  Counter 2 reset (edge sensitive)
   0.6  Sign of Life 0
   0.7  Sign of Life 1
</pre>

* *Status LED mask* - set `1` for control LED0 by *Control byte / Status LED on*; set `0` for default LED0 function (system status indication, see Monarco HAT Hardware Reference Manual).
* *Status LED on* - set `1` for LED0 lit on; set `0` for LED0 off; only applicable if *Control byte / Status LED mask* set `1`.
* *1-Wire power shutdown* - set `1` for 1-Wire bus power down (useful for bus reset in case of freeze); set `0` for normal operation.
* *RESERVED* - allways set `0`.
* *Counter 1/2 reset* - set `1` for `COUNTER1/COUNTER2 Value` reset request; set `0` for normal operation. Reset operation is edge-triggered and its completion is signalised by *Status byte / Counter 1/2 reset done* bit.
* [FUTURE] *Sign of Life 0/1* - should be incremented with each data transfer as 2bit number low/high bit, used by firmware as health check of *SPI Master*.

### PWMx frequency

f_PWM = 32 MHz / ( prescaler Ã— TOP )

<pre>
bit  1 ..  0
  00  0 : prescaler =   1
  01  1 : prescaler =   8
  10  2 : prescaler =  64
  11  3 : prescaler = 512

bit 15 ..  2 : TOP / 4
</pre>

Example:

* `0xC352 = 50002` - prescaler = 64, TOP = 50000, f_PWM = 10 Hz

For conversion form required frequency in Hz to the most sutable value of process data register function `monarco_util_pwm_freq_to_u16` can be found in file `src/monarco_util.c` in the [C language driver Repository](https://github.com/monarco/monarco-hat-driver-c/blob/master/src/monarco_util.c)

### CRC

Master to Slave data integrity is protected by 16bit CRC (cyclic redundancy check). Monarco HAT (Slave) ignores data frames with bad CRC.

There are numerous varieties of CRC-16 in common use which differs by the polynomial and its representation. Monarco HAT use the `Modbus RTU CRC-16` / `CRC-16-IBM` type, polynomial: `x^16 + x^15 + x^2 + 1` which is `0x8005` (normal) / `0xA001` (reversed), initial value: `0xFFFF`.

  22.0   2.0  Analog input 2 (0..4095 = 0..10 V, > 4095 = RESERVED)
  24.0   2.0  CRC-16
============
  26.0 ([bytes].[bits])
</pre>

### Status byte

<pre>
offset
   0.0  RESERVED
   0.1  RESERVED
   0.2  RESERVED
   0.3  RESERVED
   0.4  Counter 1 reset done
   0.5  Counter 2 reset done
   0.6  Sign of Life 0
   0.7  Sign of Life 1
</pre>

* *Counter 1/2 reset done* - signalisation of counter reset operation completion (see *Control byte* description above).
* *Sign of life 0/1* - is incremented with each data transfer as 2bit number low/high bit, can be used by *SPI Master* as health check of the Monarco HAT.

### Analog values

Values of analog inputs are internally processed by factory-calibration constants.

For the voltage measurement mode, full range input value 10.0 V equals to process data value 4095. 

For the current-loop measurement mode, theoreretical full range input value 52.475 mA equals to process data value 4095.

Function for analog values conversion can be found in file `src/monarco_util.c` in the [C language driver Repository](https://github.com/monarco/monarco-hat-driver-c/blob/master/src/monarco_util.c) 

### CRC

Slave to Master data integrity is also protected by 16bit CRC. Master should ignore data frames received with bad CRC.

The same CRC type is used as for the RX (Master to Slave) direction.


## Service data channel principles

Service data channel (SDC) provides acyclic access to set of status and configuration registers. Register is identified by `ADDRESS` (12 bit, `0x000` to `0xFFF`) and contains 16 bit `VALUE` data. 

In current firmware version, all register values are initialised to its defaults after power on (or Monarco HAT MCU reset). Persistent storage of important configuration registers is planned for future versions.

### Protocol data structure and logic

Both service data channel Request and Response share the same 4 byte data structure (`spi_data_service_t`):

<pre>
offset  size
   0.0   2.0  VALUE - Data sent (request) / received (response).
   2.0   1.4  ADDRESS - Register address to read / write.
   3.4   0.1  WRITE - Request write flag. If set, request VALUE will be written to ADDRESS.  
   3.5   0.1  ERROR - Response error flag. if set, response VALUE contains error code.
   3.6   0.2  RESERVED
</pre>

In each SPI transfer Master sends SDC Request and simultaneously receives SDC Response to previous request. Two Request types are defined:

* **Register read**
    * Request (Master > Slave): `ADDRESS` of register to be read. `VALUE = 0` (ignored). `WRITE = 0`. `ERROR = 0`.
    * Response (Slave > Master): `ADDRESS` have to be checked against the Request. `WRITE = 0`. `VALUE` contains read value if `ERROR = 0`, or Error Code if `ERROR = 1`. 

* **Register write**
    * Request (Master > Slave): `ADDRESS` of register to be written, `VALUE` to be written into the register. `WRITE = 1`. `ERROR = 0`.
    * Response (Slave > Master): `ADDRESS` and `VALUE` have to be checked against the Request if `ERROR = 0`, or `VALUE` contains Error Code if `ERROR = 1`. `WRITE = 1`.

If no register is currently required to be read or written, it is recommended to read register `0x000` - Status Word.

### Error Codes

* `0xFFFF`: Unknown Register / Write Not Allowed
* [FUTURE] separated codes for: write not allowed, invalid value, invalid state

## Timing considerations

### SPI bus timing

TODO: CS to clock start minimal delay; minimal delay between transfers

### Input sampling timing

In the current firmware version, digital, analog and counter inputs sampling is triggered by SPI data transfer completion. This means you allways read almost one cycle "old" input values.

This approach works well for short cycle times about 5 ms when sampling synchronicity is preffered.

With longer cycle times, you can prefer continuos sampling approach when you read as recent as possible input values. This option is currently being under development.
